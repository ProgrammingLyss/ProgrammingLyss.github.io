## Professional Self-Assessment


## [Code Review Video](https://youtu.be/02DJC1O0cGg)
At the start of this course, I conducted an informal code review of the 3 artifacts I chose for enhancement. This code review analyzes the code of each artifact in its current condition and discusses the plan for enhancement based off identified areas of improvement. This code review video also demonstrates my mastery of Course Outcome 2: Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.

## [Software Design/Engineering Artifact - Simple Calculator Application](https://github.com/ProgrammingLyss/ProgrammingLyss.github.io/tree/main/Simple%20Calculator%20Application)
### I. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

My chosen artifact for the Software Design/Engineering category is a simple calculator application that incorporates a standard widget toolkit (SWT) user interface. It was originally created in July of 2022, for the course CS-310: Collaboration and Team Project. 

### II. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

I selected this artifact to be included in my ePortfolio as it demonstrates my understanding of the Java programming language at a high degree, in addition to my ability to work with a SWT user interface. The user interface itself demonstrates my ability to implement arithmetic operations, as well as my ability to work with event loops and event listeners. This artifact was improved by implementing the multiply, divide, and percent functionality into the simple calculator. It was also improved by the addition of JUnit tests and comments for each new calculator function. 

### III. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

Yes, I did meet the course objectives I initially planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. My planned enhancement for this artifact was to implement 3 new calculator functions, additional JUnit tests, and additional comments. The completion of my planned enhancement demonstrates my mastery of Course Outcome 4: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. With that in mind, I have no update for my outcome-coverage plan.

### IV. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

While creating and enhancing this artifact I learned all about working with a SWT user interface. This was quite a different experience for me compared to using non-SWT user interfaces, as the SWT user interface provides access to the UI facilities of the operating system it’s implemented on. This allows for an easy incorporation of standard widgets, buttons, and text fields. The biggest challenge I faced with this artifact was setting it up my local machine. When I was originally working on this artifact during CS-310, I was using the virtual environment offered within the course. The virtual environment provided the Eclipse IDE on a Windows platform, but my local machine uses Mac OS where the Eclipse IDE looks very different from its Windows counterpart. This created a bit of a learning curve for me as I’ve always opted for the virtual environment over setting up IDEs on my local machine whenever possible, but I was thankfully able to overcome it with minimal difficulty. 

## [Algorithms and Data Structures Artifact - Mobile Application](https://github.com/ProgrammingLyss/ProgrammingLyss.github.io/tree/main/Mobile%20Application)
### I.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

My chosen artifact for the Algorithms and Data Structures category is a mobile application that uses JUnit testing to ensure complete functionality. It was originally created in September of 2022, for the course CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. 

### II.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

I selected this artifact to be included in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my understanding of the Java programming language at a high degree, as well as my ability to create efficient and effective JUnit tests. The individual JUnit tests showcase my ability to conduct quality software testing, as well as my ability to incorporate appropriate assertions that provide accurate failure messages. This artifact was improved by implementing various JUnit test cases for the Task and Task Service classes, which previously had no JUnit tests at all. It was also improved by adding relevant comments throughout the code. 

### III.	Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

Yes, I did meet the course objectives I initially planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. My planned enhancement for this artifact was to increase the coverage of the JUnit tests and add comments throughout the code. The completion of my planned enhancement demonstrates my mastery of Course Outcome 3: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. With that in mind, I have no update for my outcome-coverage plan. 

### IV.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? 

While creating the application I learned all about using JUnit testing to ensure complete application functionality. The initial purpose of this artifact was to ensure the functionality of the mobile application solely through JUnit testing, meaning that the JUnit tests are the only executable part of the application. Learning how to craft JUnit tests that ensure the complete functionality of an application was a great learning experience, and a valuable skill that I’ll be able to use in my future career. Thankfully, I had no major challenges while creating and enhancing this artifact. 

## [Databases Artifact - Dashboard Application](https://github.com/ProgrammingLyss/ProgrammingLyss.github.io/tree/main/Dashboard%20Application)
### I.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

My chosen artifact for the Databases category is a software application with full stack development, including a database and a client-facing web application dashboard through which users will access the database. It was originally created in January 2023, for the course CS-340: Client/Server Development. 

### II.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

I selected this artifact to be included in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to conduct end-to-end development of an application. I also selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my understanding of MongoDB and the Python programming language at a high level. The back end of the application demonstrates my ability to create and work with a database in MongoDB, and the front end of the application demonstrates my ability to create a user-friendly dashboard interface that connects to the database with Python. This artifact was improved by implementing user authentication to access the AAC database. It was also improved by cleaning up the comments throughout the code. 

### III.	Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

Yes, I did meet the course objectives I initially planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. My planned enhancement for this artifact was to implement user authentication and clean up the comments throughout the code. The completion of my planned enhancement demonstrates my mastery of Course Outcome 5: Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. With that in mind, I have no update for my outcome-coverage plan. 

### IV.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? 

While creating this artifact, I learned all about conducting full stack development of an application. I learned how to connect a MongoDB database to a Python dashboard application, which was a great learning experience for me as I had never conducted end-to-end development of an application before. The only challenge I faced with this artifact was the geolocation chart. I did investigate this issue when the artifact was originally created and while I was working on my planned enhancements, but ultimately I was unable to figure out why the chart does not appear on the dashboard with everything else. Aside from that, I had no issues while creating and enhancing this artifact.
