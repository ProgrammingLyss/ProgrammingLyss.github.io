## Professional Self-Assessment

I have been in the Computer Science program at SNHU for four and a half years. When I started this program, I had no prior work experience in the field and very limited knowledge of its concepts. By completing the course work throughout the program, I've gained critically important skills such as collaborating in a team environment and communicating to stakeholders, which has prepared me to enter the workforce in the Computer Science field. Developing this ePortfolio has helped showcase my strengths through the presentation of enhanced artifacts in 3 categories: Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

The artifacts featured in this ePortfolio were specifically chosen to demonstrate the full range of my Computer Science talents and abilities. The Software Design/Engineering artifact is a simple calculator application that demonstrates my abiity to conduct front-end development with Java. The Algorithms and Data Structures artifact is a mobile application that demonstrates my ability to conduct front-end development and front-end testing with Java. The Databases artifact is a dashboard application that demonstrates my ability to conduct full-stack development with Python, Jupyter Notebook, and MongoDB. This professional self-assessment demonstrates my mastery of Course Outcome 1: Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.

### I. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

My chosen artifact for the Software Design/Engineering category is a simple calculator application that incorporates a standard widget toolkit (SWT) user interface. It was originally created in July of 2022, for the course CS-310: Collaboration and Team Project. 

### II. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

I selected this artifact to be included in my ePortfolio as it demonstrates my understanding of the Java programming language at a high degree, in addition to my ability to work with a SWT user interface. The user interface itself demonstrates my ability to implement arithmetic operations, as well as my ability to work with event loops and event listeners. This artifact was improved by implementing the multiply, divide, and percent functionality into the simple calculator. It was also improved by the addition of various JUnit tests and comments justifying the implementation of each new calculator function. 

### III. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

Yes, I did meet the course objectives I initially planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. My planned enhancement for this artifact was to implement 3 new calculator functions, additional JUnit tests, and additional comments. The completion of my planned enhancement demonstrates my mastery of Course Outcome 4: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. With that in mind, I have no update for my outcome-coverage plans.

### IV. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

While creating and enhancing this artifact I learned all about working with a SWT user interface. This was quite a different experience for me compared to using non-SWT user interfaces, as the SWT user interface provides access to the UI facilities of the operating system it’s implemented on. This allows for an easy incorporation of standard widgets, buttons, and text fields. The biggest challenge I faced with this artifact was setting it up my local machine. When I was originally working on this artifact during CS-310, I was using the virtual environment offered within the course. The virtual environment provided the Eclipse IDE on a Windows platform, but my local machine uses Mac OS where the Eclipse IDE looks very different from its Windows counterpart. This created a bit of a learning curve for me as I’ve always opted for the virtual environment over setting up IDEs on my local machine whenever possible, but I was thankfully able to overcome it with minimal difficulty. 

## Algorithms and Data Structures Artifact - Mobile Application

### I.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

My chosen artifact for the Algorithms and Data Structures category is a mobile application that uses JUnit testing to ensure complete functionality. It was originally created in September of 2022, for the course CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. 

### II.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

I selected this artifact to be included in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my understanding of the Java programming language at a high degree, as well as my ability to create efficient and effective JUnit tests. The individual JUnit tests showcase my ability to conduct quality software testing, as well as my ability to incorporate appropriate assertions that provide accurate failure messages. This artifact was improved by implementing various JUnit test cases for the Task and Task Service classes, which previously had no JUnit tests at all. It was also improved by adding relevant comments throughout the code. 

### III.	Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

Yes, I did meet the course objectives I initially planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. My planned enhancement for this artifact was to increase the coverage of the JUnit tests and add comments throughout the code. The completion of my planned enhancement demonstrates my mastery of Course Outcome 3: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. With that in mind, I have no update for my outcome-coverage plans. 

### IV.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? 

While creating the application I learned all about using JUnit testing to ensure complete application functionality. The initial purpose of this artifact was to ensure the functionality of the mobile application solely through JUnit testing, meaning that the JUnit tests are the only executable part of the application. Learning how to craft JUnit tests that ensure the complete functionality of an application was a great learning experience, and a valuable skill that I’ll be able to use in my future career. Thankfully, I had no major challenges while creating and enhancing this artifact.

With that in mind, I have no update for my outcome-coverage plans. 

### IV.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? 

While creating this artifact, I learned all about conducting full stack development of an application. I learned how to connect a MongoDB database to a Python dashboard application, which was a great learning experience for me as I had never conducted end-to-end development of an application before. The only challenge I faced with this artifact was the geolocation chart. I did investigate this issue when the artifact was originally created and while I was working on my planned enhancements, but ultimately I was unable to figure out why the chart does not appear on the dashboard with everything else. Aside from that, I had no issues while creating and enhancing this artifact.
