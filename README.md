## [Code Review Video](https://youtu.be/02DJC1O0cGg)
At the start of this course, I conducted an informal code review of the 3 artifacts I chose for enhancement. This code review analyzes the code of each artifact in its current condition and discusses the plan for enhancement based off identified areas of improvement. 

## Software Design/Engineering Artifact - Simple Calculator Application
### I. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

My chosen artifact for the Software Design/Engineering category is a simple calculator application that incorporates a standard widget toolkit (SWT) user interface. It was originally created in July of 2022, for the course CS-310: Collaboration and Team Project. 

### II. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

I selected this artifact to be included in my ePortfolio as it demonstrates my understanding of the Java programming language at a high degree, in addition to my ability to work with a SWT user interface. The user interface itself demonstrates my ability to implement arithmetic operations, as well as my ability to work with event loops and event listeners. This artifact was improved by implementing the multiply, divide, and percent functionality into the simple calculator. It was also improved by the addition of JUnit tests and comments for each new calculator function. 

### III. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

Yes, I did meet the course objectives I initially planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One. My planned enhancements for this artifact was to implement 3 new calculator functions, additional JUnit tests, and additional comments. The completion of my planned enhancements demonstrates my achievement of Course Outcome 4: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. With that in mind, I have no update for my outcome-coverage plan.

### IV. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

While creating and enhancing this artifact I learned all about working with a SWT user interface. This was quite a different experience for me compared to using non-SWT user interfaces, as the SWT user interface provides access to the UI facilities of the operating system it’s implemented on. This allows for an easy incorporation of standard widgets, buttons, and text fields. The biggest challenge I faced with this artifact was setting it up my local machine. When I was originally working on this artifact during CS-310, I was using the virtual environment offered within the course. The virtual environment provided the Eclipse IDE on a Windows platform, but my local machine uses Mac OS where the Eclipse IDE looks very different from its Windows counterpart. This created a bit of a learning curve for me as I’ve always opted for the virtual environment over setting up IDEs on my local machine whenever possible, but I was thankfully able to overcome it with minimal difficulty.
